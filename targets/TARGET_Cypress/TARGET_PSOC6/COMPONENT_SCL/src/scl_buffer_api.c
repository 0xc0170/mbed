/** Allocates a packet buffer

 *  Attempts to allocate a packet buffer of the size requested. It can do this
 *  by allocating a pre-existing packet from a pool, using a static buffer,
 *  or by dynamically allocating memory. The method of allocation does not
 *  concern SCL, however it must match the way the network stack expects packet
 *  buffers to be allocated.
 *
 *  @param buffer    : A pointer which receives the allocated packet buffer handle
 *  @param direction : Indicates transmit/receive direction that the packet buffer is
 *                    used for. This may be needed if tx/rx pools are separate.
 *  @param size      : The number of bytes to allocate.
 *  @param wait      : Whether to wait for a packet buffer to be available
 *
 *  @return          : SCL_SUCCESS or error code
